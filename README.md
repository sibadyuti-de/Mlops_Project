Here is a Simple example of face recognizion door lock system .
Here is my system :-  


**Required Library of Python is :-**
you can install it with 
```bash
pip install cmake
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition
```
if you face any error to install dlib library then use the dlib library and follow the commands
```bash
pip install C:\face-recognition_dlib_library-master\dlib-19.19.0-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
```
i use cp37 because my python is v3.7 if you have 3.8 use cp38m

This is the python codes which run on machine.
After Run the code it will detect My face if matched the door will be wnlocked for 3 seconds the turned off autometically.

here is the process of the detecting code.

here is the Schematics of electronics components which required for the Relay Which can control Higher voltages.
Here is some working picture of the full system.
